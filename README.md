# Low Level Constraint Language

**Right now, everything is being rewritten in type script.**

<!-- Currently, I am trying to make a usable low level language language incorporating [my constraint system](./constraints.llcl). -->

<!-- **Right now the compiler is very unstable. (I keep adding and removing features)** -->

I am working on this programming language for personal use,
but the source code is public on github because someone might find this interesting.

Right now the compiler is being made for macOS.
But it may work on other platforms.

<!-- ## Extension -->

<!-- I have been working on a [vscode extension](https://github.com/StarsShadow-dev/LLCL-extension) for this language. -->
